# Maximum-sum-in-matrix

The program accepts matrix as an unser input row by row. The function maximum_array then computes a 2D array max_array and returns the max_sum that can be computed while travelling from 0,0 to n,m.

The max_sum array is a two dimensional array of size n*m which contains
the maximum sum  that can be achieved till you reach node i,j where 0 <= i <= n and 0 <= j <= n.
